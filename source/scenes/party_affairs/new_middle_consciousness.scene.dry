= Class Consciousness of the New Middle Class

As socialism grows increasingly popular around the country, it has begun to take hold of the new middle class as well, with them becoming more and more open to socialist ideas and increasingly considering themselves part of the proletariat. Though still by far more moderate than the industrial workers, there is real potential to be exploited here in order to expand the SPD's base without diluting its class character.

We have taken advantage of the situation, and awoken the class character of the white collar workers. Increasingly, they flock to our party.

@refute

We will not do this.
