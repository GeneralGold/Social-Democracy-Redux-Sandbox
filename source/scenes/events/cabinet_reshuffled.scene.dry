= Cabinet Reshuffled

@menu

[+ chancellor +] has announced his intentions to [+ president +] to reshuffle the cabinet, sacking and replacing all current SPD ministers and replacing them with bourgeois ones. [? if bourgeois_coalition < 50 and right_coalition < 50 : Luckily, they lack a majority without us, so we can bring them down with a simple motion of no confidence. ?]

- @try_assuage: Try to assuage our partners.
- @right_coalition: The DNVP replaces us in government.
- @bourgeois_coalition: The bourgeois have a lone majority.
- @tolerate: Let the reshuffle happen, and tolerate the new minority government.
- @no_tolerate: Bring down this new backstabbing government!

@try_assuage

How do we assuage our partners?

- @give_up_prussia: Give up on leadership of Prussia.
- @austerity: Enact a massive austerity plan.
- @resources: Use our resources to reduce dissent within the coalition.
- @menu: Never mind. What are our options?

Fine. We no longer control the government of Prussia. The vote has been called off.

@austerity
view-if: welfare >= 0

Fine. We enacted a massive austerity program to cut welfare, in order to maintain the stability of our coalition. The vote has been called off.

@resources
choose-if: resources >= 3
unavailable-subtitle: We do not have enough resources.
subtitle: -3 resources
on-arrival: resources -= 3; coalition_dissent -= 1;

By transferring resources to our coalition partners, we can reduce their dissent against our policies. This is a crude, but effective solution.

Many in the party are incredulous. We have just been expelled from government, and our reaction is to allow this government to govern?

The vote succeeds, and their government has resigned. Chancellor Brüning remains as the head of an acting government, consisting solely of the bourgeois parties. He immediately proceeds to cut welfare spending substantially.

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].
