= Saar Referendum

Following Germany’s defeat in the Great War, the Saarland was made into a League of Nations mandate under de-facto French control. Now, however, a referendum is scheduled to take place to decide the future of the territory.

The vote to rejoin Germany is widely expected to succeed, though ultimately the highly Catholic population of the region will be the deciding factor. 

- @campaign_pro: Campaign in favor of rejoining Germany.
- @campaign_anti: Campaign against rejoining Germany.

@campaign_pro
on-arrival: spd_saar = 1; saar_pro += (nationalism*2); saar_pro = catholics_spd_normalized; saar_pro += catholics_z_normalized if (z_relation >= 20 or not spd_in_government); saar_anti += (progressive_coalition/5); saar_anti += (homosexual_rights*8); saar_anti += (womens_rights*2); saar_pro += 25 if concordat; saar_anti += 10/(west_relation+1) if west_relation > 0; saar_anti += 20 if west_relation < 0; saar_pro += sa_force; {!
var saar = Q.saar_pro + Q.saar_anti;
Q.saar_pro = Math.round((Q.saar_pro/saar)*100);
Q.saar_anti = Math.round((Q.saar_anti/saar)*100);
!}

Of course, we campaign in favor of reincorporation. [? if z_relation >= 25 : The Center Party does as well, helping swing the Catholics. ?]

- @victory: [+ saar_pro +]% vote in favor of rejoining Germany.
- @defeat: [+ saar_pro +]% vote in favor of rejoining Germany.

Due to the threat of the Republic soon falling, we make the heavy handed decision to campaign for a continuation of the mandate. The Nazis gleefully label us traitors to Germany, and our support amongst more nationalistic demographics is hurt.

- @victory: [+ saar_pro +]% vote in favor of rejoining Germany.
- @defeat: [+ saar_pro +]% vote in favor of rejoining Germany.

@victory
view-if: saar_pro >= 50
on-arrival: saarland = 1; catholics += 1; workers_nsdap += 5 if ((saar_pro-sa_force) < 50); workers_spd -= 3 if saar_pro < 70; dvp_relation -= 4 if saar_pro < 70; nationalism += 3

As expected, the vote to rejoin Germany wins with [+ saar_pro +]%. [? if ((saar_pro-sa_force) < 50) : The Nazis were very active in the campaign, intimidating voters with their SA, and have claimed the victory as theirs. ?]

[? if saar_pro < 70 : The margin of victory was surprisingly close for comfort, and our credibility is hurt as a result. ?]

@defeat
view-if: saar_pro < 50
on-arrival: workers_spd -= 4 if spd_saar == 1; new_middle_spd -= 4 if spd_saar == 1; old_middle_spd -= 5 if spd_saar == 1; unemployed_spd -= 4 if spd_saar == 1; rural_spd -= 5 if spd_saar == 1; workers_nsdap -= 5 if spd_saar != 1; new_middle_nsdap -= 8 if spd_saar != 1; old_middle_nsdap -= 8 if spd_saar != 1; unemployed_nsdap -= 5 if nsdap_saar != 1; rural_nsdap -= 7 if nsdap_saar == 1; 

Somehow, a majority of [+ saar_anti +]% have voted to stay as a League of Nations mandate. This is a great embarrassment to [? if spd_saar : us ?][? if not spd_saar : the NSDAP ?] as it was widely expected that the vast majority would favor Germany.
