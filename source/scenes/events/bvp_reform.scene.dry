= The Bavarian Workers' Party

With the transformation of Germany into a council republic with delegates elected by workers' councils, the Bavarian People's Party has undergone a significant shift, as, relying on the new workers' councils scattered throughout Bavaria to maintain relevance, their labor wing has overtaken the party.

Adjusting to the new climate, they have become the **Bavarian Workers' Party**, ensuring that they will continue to win roughly 3% in every election, now from the workers' councils of the state.
