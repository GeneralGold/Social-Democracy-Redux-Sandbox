= [+ year +] Nazi Party Congress

After abandoning revolutionary tactics with the failure of the Beer Hall Putsch and instead attempting to subvert democracy from within through hardline, non-compromising parliamentary participation, the Nazis have seen their tactics yet again fail.

Now, emerging from a long period of internal re-consolidation, the Nazis have unveiled their new party manifesto. On the surface a significant moderation, [+ nsdap_leader +]'s convictions and those of his party remain unchanged. The Nazis have simply undergone the next natural change in the strategy for destroying democracy, becoming a true trojan horse.

- @concern: A troubling development.
- @iron_front: Maintain pressure on the fascists with the Iron Front!

on-arrival: nazi_urgency += 1

Hopefully, by now democracy has been entrenched enough that it will be impossible for the Nazis to dislodge.
