= Political Crisis

For multiple elections in a row now, no government has been able to be formed. This has been destroying the trust of the German people in their democracy, and all eyes turn to the president to see what he will do.

Otto Gessler has become increasingly influenced by his inner cadre of military men and seeing the total inability of the Reichstag to form a government has caved to their increasing calls for martial law. 

He has asked Wilhelm Groener to lead a temporary military government and, wielding the powers of Article 48 of the German constitution, declared martial law and cancelled the next elections.

go-to: next_election_time

Adenauer, tired of the chaos, sacks the current chancellor and replaces him with Adam Stegerwald, who has launched a sweeping campaign for the Center Party, calling for law and order and harshly attacking the Nazis as being, in a sense, 'posers', for throwing Germany into disarray while claiming to desire nothing but its greatness.

@eckener_crisis
on-arrival: chancellor = "Groener"; spd_toleration = 0; chancellor_party = "I"; time_to_election = 6+strife; strife -= 3; sa_militancy -= 0.1; rb_militancy -= 0.1 if rb_militancy >= 0.1; rfb_militancy -= 0.1; sh_militancy -= 0.05; reichswehr_loyalty += 0.05;
go-to: fascist_uprising if coup_progress >= 10 and sa_force+sh_force >= 45 and nsdap_r+dnvp_r >= 35; next_election_time if coup_progress < 10 or sa_force+sh_force < 45 or nsdap_r+dnvp_r < 35

Hugo Eckener, seeing the devolving situation in Germany and convinced that a strong hand is needed, appoints Wilhelm Groener chancellor of a temporary military cabinet and declared martial law, swearing this as a temporary measure to secure Germany's future.

@fascist_uprising
on-arrival: sh_strength *= 0.8; sh_strength *= 0.9 if president == "Eckener"; reichswehr_loyalty += 0.1; reichswehr_loyalty += 0.1 if president == "Gessler"; nazi_rebel = 1

Infuriated by this action, the Nazi SA launches an armed insurrection, attempting to seize and take over key infrastructure across the country as the army is deployed against them. Due to the circumstances of the uprising, the Harzburg Front is split, and many in the Stalhelm hesitate.

- @civil_war: Nonetheless, it is a civil war.

# todo: SPD response section if no fascist uprising, eg general strike against martial law..?

@nothing_to_do
on-arrival: reichswehr_loyalty -= 0.1; sh_strength += 100; sa_strength += 100; pro_republic -= 5; coup_progress += no_majority_elections/2

With presidential powers weakened, there is nothing that can be done. The republic may not last much longer.

@next_election_time
on-arrival: next_election_time = time+time_to_election; next_election_month = month + time_to_election; next_election_year = year; next_election_year += 1 if next_election_month > 12; next_election_month -= 12 if next_election_month > 12; next_election_year += 1 if next_election_month > 12; next_election_month -= 12 if next_election_month > 12;
