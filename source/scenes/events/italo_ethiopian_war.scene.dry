= Second Italo-Ethiopian War

After months of unresolved escalation and weak League of Nations action, Italian forces have launched an invasion of Ethiopia, sparking the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. Despite our best efforts to sway them against Italy, France and Britain seem to distrust us and our motives, and are unwilling to alienate a potential ally against us.

#Italian forces have invaded Ethiopia from Eritrea, sparking a war between the two states. This comes following a prior crisis where Italian forces, operating a garrison well within Ethiopian territory, refused to cooperate with an Anglo-Ethiopian survey of the region and, after a standoff, attacked the Ethiopian encampment.

# todo: global tension. if global tension hits 10, event about increasing tensions, forcing germany to back a bloc, the soviets or the west
