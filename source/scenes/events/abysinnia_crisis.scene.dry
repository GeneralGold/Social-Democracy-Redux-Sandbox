= Abysinnia Crisis

What started as an Anglo-Ethiopian border survey near Somalia has spiralled into an international incident after a skirmish broke out in Walwal between an Ethiopian encampment and an Italian garrison. 

Ethiopia has requested League of Nations arbitration, with both sides demanding compensation for the other's aggression. If not handled correctly, the crisis could escalate.

@non_govt

- @no_foreign: The Foreign Ministry backs France and Britain in their mediation of the crisis.
- @kpd_foreign: The Foreign Ministry condemns Italian actions.

Influenced by France and Britain, and backed by Germany, the League of Nations absolves both sides of responsibility[? if not unresolved_abysinnia :, though Italy has been warned to halt its military buildup in the region. ?][? if unresolved_abysinnia :. ?][? if west_relation >= 3 and not unresolved_abysinnia : A general consensus has been reached between Germany and France to halt Italian expansion should they not relent in their ambitions on the region. ?]

on-arrival: west_relation -= 2; workers_kpd += 3; new_middle_kpd += 2; dvp_relation -= 3; soviet_relation += 1; unresolved_abysinnia = 1

The Communist foreign ministry condemns Italian aggression and colonialism, though the League of Nations absolves both sides of responsibility anyway, with France and Britain unwilling to take a firm course of action against Italy.

# todo: france and britain will also do the same if KPD-influenced germany, even if SPD foreign ministry

@control_foreign

With our control of the Foreign Ministry, it is up to us to control Germany's position through the Abysinnia Crisis. [? if west_relation >= 2 : Luckily, France does not see us as much of a threat, so they are likely to focus more on Italy. ?]

- @hardline: Demand an end to Italy's military buildup and side with Ethiopia.
- @mediate: Agree with the consensus and absolve both sides of responsibility.

We act firmly and decisively to end Italian expansionism, and thanks to our good relations with France and Britain our plan is agreed upon. Sanctions are placed [? if eu : through the European Union ?] and the dispute is arbitrated firmly in Ethiopia's favor. Italy eventually backs down, thoroughly humbled and with its own fascist regime embarassed.

This has been a victory for peace in the world, and a defeat for fascists and militarists.

# todo: followup event in 8 months: italy continues gradual escalation, and tries to convince britain and france to allow them some concessions. or, if firm hand, none at all.
# todo: france and britain more skeptical and wary of germany if highly leftist, and as a result less willing to bully italy
