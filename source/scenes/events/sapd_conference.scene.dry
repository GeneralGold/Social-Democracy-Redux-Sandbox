The SAPD, enjoying in its recent growth, has launched a manifesto and program calling for the SPD and KPD to put aside their differences and convene in an SAPD arbitrated conference for the formation of an "Einheitsfront" of the workers. If we refuse, it may reflect badly, especially on our working class base, and give the SAPD more ammunition.

- @participate_good_faith_1: We will attend this conference as a means of reconciling with the KPD.
- @participate_good_faith_2: We will attend this conference as a means of reconciling with the KPD.
- @participate_good_faith_3: We will attend this conference as a means of reconciling with the KPD.
- @participate_bad_faith_1: We will attend this conference as a means of showing that reconciliation is impossible and hopeless.
- @participate_bad_faith_2: We will attend this conference as a means of showing that reconciliation is impossible and hopeless.
- @participate_bad_faith_3: We will attend this conference as a means of showing that reconciliation is impossible and hopeless.
- @refuse_1: Let the SAPD delude themselves with ideas of a united front, we will have no part in it.
- @refuse_2: Let the SAPD delude themselves with ideas of a united front, we will have no part in it.

We agree to the idea and participate in the conference that the SAPD calls. To our surprise, the KPD not only participates but seems to do so in good faith with genuine interest in reconciliation [? if kpd_leader == "Conciliators" : , undoubtedly under the influence of their Conciliator leadership ?]. Multiple agreements are reached, with the SAPD mediating many of the disputes, and the conference ends as a propaganda victory for the SAPD as well as what remains of our party's left-wing, and a noticeable increase in our relations with the KPD. Our party's right, as well as the country's, accuse us of collaboration with the Communists, and our relations with them have worsened.

Whether this will be the start of a new course or not remains to be seen.

We agree to the idea and participate in the conference that the SAPD calls. The KPD too participates, but seems to do so out of obligation rather than genuine goodwill. They, intransingent as always, set forth unreasonable demands, including [? if kpd_rectified_history = 0 : the expulsion of Noske from the party, ?][? if spd_toleration : the breaking of our toleration agreement, ?] the adoption of a more radically and revolutionary socialist agenda, and the breaking of ties with the Right.

- @accept_kpd: We will accept these demands.
- @refuse_kpd: We will refuse these outrageous demands.

Despite the opposition of the right-wing, we have agreed to the KPD's demands. This has shaken the party to its core, and caused a shift back towards the left. The KPD themselves are shocked, but quickly adapt to the new reality, ready to collaborate with the SPD though still viewing us with suspicion. The SAPD has meanwhile lost steam, with many rejoining the SPD.

Of course, we could never agree to such outrageous demands. The conference is a failure, and we blame the KPD for it. The SAPD continues to agitate for a united front, pointing to the failure of the SPD and KPD to cooperate as a reason to vote for the SAPD instead, but this thankfully doesn't effect us too much.

We attend the SAPD conference, but are alone in doing so, with the KPD refusing. We accuse the KPD of being the reason for the failure of an Einheitsfront to take form, and our ties with the left and SAPD are somewhat repaired. The SAPD campaigns off of the KPD's failure to participate, taking yet more support away from them. The right-wing though, both of our party and as a whole, are nevertheless disgruntled by our participation.

We attend the SAPD conference, though not out of genuine will to reconcile but to try and weaken the SAPD's propaganda and prove reconciliation impossible. Frustratingly, the KPD has not done the same, and appear more reasonable than us. We put forward demands that we know the KPD can never accept, such as a full acceptance of the Weimar constitution, disbanding of the RFB into the Reichsbanner, and the leaving of the Comintern in favor of the Second International.

- @kpd_accept: The KPD shockingly accepts most of our demands.
- @kpd_refuse_offer: The KPD, as expected, refuses.

unavailable-subtitle: The KPD would never accept any of these outrageous demands.

To our surprise, the Conciliator KPD leadership has shown willingness to accept most of these demands. They have proposed a counteroffer, to integrate the RFB under the Reichsbanner while still maintaining its operational independence, and to promise to operate by the methods outlined in the constitution, rather than endorsing the constitution itself. Of course, though, the demand they leave the Comintern is unacceptable so long as Moscow retains its iron grip over worldwide communist parties.

- @accept_counteroffer: We will accept this fair counteroffer.
- @reject_counteroffer: We will refuse this counteroffer, despite our accidental progress.

We may not have originally intended for reconciliation but this deal is too good to pass up. If the KPD is truly willing to abide by these, we will accept. This is a great day for German democracy.

We had no intention of reconciliation and that we got this far is a miracle, but that changes nothing. We refuse, and the SAPD and KPD label us as traitors.

As expected, the KPD refuses our outrageous demands. The conference is a failure, and the KPD and SAPD both blame us. The SAPD continues to agitate for a united front, pointing to the failure of the SPD and KPD to cooperate as a reason to vote for the SAPD instead, to some success.

We attend the SAPD conference, though not out of genuine will to reconcile but to try and weaken the SAPD's propaganda and prove reconciliation impossible. The KPD does the same, and the conference is a disaster as the SAPD struggles to control heated arguments. Any hope of leftist unity that remained has died with this conference, which, although their attempts to paint both us and the KPD as unreasonable and them as an alternative, has taken much steam out of the SAPD's campaign as their goal of an Einheitsfront is seen as increasingly impossible.

We refuse to attend, but, unfortunately for us, the KPD agrees and participates. Our support is weakened as we are the only ones absent, and the SAPD grows ever closer to the KPD. This has been a propaganda victory for the far-left, which leads to further far-right mobilization.

We refuse to attend, as does the SAPD. They dedicate the conference to themselves, accompanied by many of our most leftwing members who attend anyway, as well as the KPD's rightmost. With both of our parties failing to entertain negotiations, the SAPD pushes itself as the only party able to forge an Einheitsfront of the workers, and this seems to work as they grow yet further.
