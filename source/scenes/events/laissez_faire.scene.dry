= [+ chancellor +]'s Economic Plan

As the crisis begins to subside worldwide, the [+ chancellor +] cabinet, hoping to stimulate foreign investment to get the economy repaired, have begun rolling back workers' protections, backing employers strongly in labor disputes, cutting welfare, and cutting taxes. Economic growth has marginally increased, but the fruits of this recovery are not being felt in the slightest by the working class.
